Man-up repo
===========

This is the Manchester Ultimate Programming repository.

All tested on Ubuntu 11.04 64 bit

For each project run the setup script within the directory, this 
should install the correct libraries etc.

    ./setup.sh

"scripts" contains the scripts to install the correct sdks and libs.

If you experience problems installing, please raise as an issue,
ideally we have it so that the only pre-requisite is an installation
of Ubuntu (insert latest version).
